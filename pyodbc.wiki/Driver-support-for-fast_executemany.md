Not all ODBC drivers support *parameter arrays*, the internal ODBC mechanism that `fast_executemany` uses to do its magic. If you have additional or updated information on a particular driver please feel free to update this list.

| Database | Driver Name | Driver Version | OS | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Access | Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb) | Access 2010 | Windows | crashes CPython | |
| Microsoft SQL Server | ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server | 17.x | Linux/Windows | **works** | [local temporary tables](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks-by-Database-Platform#using-fast_executemany-with-a-temporary-table), [TVPs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/601) |
| Microsoft SQL Server | FreeTDS [libtdsodbc.so] | 01.00.0082 | Linux | crashes CPython | |
| MySQL | MySQL ODBC 8.0 ANSI Driver | 8.0.15 | Linux | does not work | |
| MySQL | MySQL ODBC 8.0 ANSI Driver | 8.0.17 | Windows | crashes CPython | |
| MySQL | MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver | 8.0.12 | Windows | no effect | |
| Oracle | Oracle ODBC instant client 19.9 | 19.9 | Linux | **works** | |
| PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL Unicode(x64) | 11.01.00 | Windows | no effect | |
| SAP ASE (Sybase) | Adaptive Server Enterprise (ANSI) [libsybdrvodb-sqllen8.so] | 16.0.03.02 | Linux | **works** | tested using `charset=utf8` |
| SAP ASE (Sybase) | FreeTDS [libtdsodbc.so] | 01.01.0036 | Linux | crashes CPython | |

"No effect" means that enabling `fast_executemany` does not seem to cause problems, but it also doesn't make any significant difference to the amount of network traffic generated by an `executemany` call.
